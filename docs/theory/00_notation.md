# Notation (canonical)

## Core processes
- Aggregate output: Y_t
- Output dynamics: dY_t / Y_t = mu_Y dt + sigma_Y dW_t

## Demographics
- Death/birth intensity: nu
- Cohort born at s has mass at t: nu * exp(-nu (t-s))

## Assets
- Risk-free: dB_t / B_t = r_t dt
- Stock total return: dS_t + D_t dt

## Key equilibrium objects
- xi_{s,t}^i : (perceived) SDF / state-price density for type i cohort s
- phi_{s,t}^i : wealth-to-consumption ratio for agent (s,i)
- f_{s,t}^i = c_{s,t}^i / Y_t : consumption share
