# Objects to implement (contract)

## Exogenous
- params: mu_y, sigma_y, nu, rho, omega

## Simulated
- t grid, Y_t path

## Equilibrium (benchmark log)
- r (risk-free rate)
- phi (aggregate wealth-to-consumption or price ratio)
- p_over_y (price-output or price-dividend ratio; define clearly)
- pi (portfolio share / dollar investment; define clearly)

## Later (general heterogeneity)
- phi^i(f) in steady state
- coupled ODE/PDE system solver
